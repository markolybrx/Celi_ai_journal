    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 26, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Celi</strong> ("we," "our," or "the System"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your digital legacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and delete your data when you use the Celi AI Journaling application.</p>
    <p>By using Celi, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1. User Account Data</h3>
    <p>To create your unique "Cosmic Identity," we collect the following personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Credentials:</strong> Username and encrypted password hash.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Data:</strong> First name, last name, date of birth, and "Aura Color" preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Secret questions and hashed answers for account recovery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2. User-Generated Content (The "Journal")</h3>
    <p>We collect the content you voluntarily provide to the System, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Text Entries:</strong> Daily journal logs, reflections, and descriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>"The Void" Entries:</strong> Content explicitly marked as "Rants" or "Void" entries. While these are visualized differently in the user interface (e.g., Red Stars), they are stored with the same security protocols as standard entries.</li>
        <li><strong>Media Files:</strong> Photos and audio voice notes uploaded during chat sessions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3. System Metadata</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Metrics:</strong> Stardust currency balance, Rank progression (e.g., "Observer III"), and login streaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Constellation Data:</strong> Semantic groupings of your entries generated by AI analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>

    <h3>3.1. Service Provision</h3>
    <p>We use your data to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide the journaling interface and "Galaxy Map" visualization.</li>
        <li>Track your "Stardust" rewards and rank progression.</li>
        <li>Render your "Constellation" paths and history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2. AI Analysis & The "Echo Protocol"</h3>
    <p>Celi utilizes Artificial Intelligence (Google Gemini) to enhance your experience. Your data is processed to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Analyze Sentiment:</strong> Generate psychological insights and daily summaries based on your text.</li>
        <li><strong>Vector Memory ("Echo Protocol"):</strong> Your text entries are converted into mathematical vector embeddings. This allows the System to identify patterns and surface relevant past memories during your conversations (e.g., "This reminds me of...").</li>
        <li><strong>Semantic Naming:</strong> Automatically generate thematic titles for groups of journal entries (e.g., "The Week of Resilience").</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage & Architecture</h2>

    <h3>4.1. Database Storage</h3>
    <p>All text-based data (User Profiles, Journal Logs, Vector Embeddings) is stored securely in <strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong> (Cloud Database).</p>

    <h3>4.2. Media Storage (GridFS)</h3>
    <p>To ensure performance and data integrity, high-bandwidth media (Images and Audio Files) are decoupled from the main database. They are stored using <strong>MongoDB GridFS</strong>, a distributed file storage system. Your journal entries retain only a secure cryptographic reference (ObjectId) to these files.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party AI Processing</h2>
    <p>Celi uses <strong>Google Gemini</strong> as its underlying intelligence engine.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transient Processing:</strong> Text and media sent to Gemini are used solely for the purpose of generating an immediate response or analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>No Model Training:</strong> We do not grant third-party AI providers the right to use your personal journal entries to train their public models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. User Rights & Data Deletion</h2>

    <h3>6.1. The "Wipe Memory" Protocol</h3>
    <p>You retain full ownership of your data. The application includes a "Wipe Memory" function located in your Profile settings.</p>

    <h3>6.2. Consequences of Deletion</h3>
    <p>Triggering the "Wipe Memory" protocol is <strong>irreversible</strong>. It will immediately:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Permanently delete all text history from the history collection.</li>
        <li>Destroy all mathematical vector embeddings associated with your identity.</li>
        <li>Remove all Stardust, Ranks, and progress.</li>
        <li>Unlink all associated Media files (Images/Audio) from your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
